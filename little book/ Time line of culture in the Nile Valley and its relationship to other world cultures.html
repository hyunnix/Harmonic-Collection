        Time Line of Culture in the Nile Valley and its Relationship to Other World Cultures</h1>
    
    <p style="font-family:courier;">The book “Time Line of Culture in the Nile Valley and its Relationship to Other World Cultures” is a folded sheet book of about 35 x 11 cm. This paper size definitely helps the author to lay pictures of those Egyptian object collections. Each object shares one page the reader can clearly understand all the descriptions on each page and directly locate the object. It has a paper cover of the same color yellow as the book itself. There are three headlines on the top of the pages, including the origin of the object, the historical period, and its dynasty, 
        It is an overall guide to the Egyptian antiquities in the Lila Acheson Wallace Galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art organized chronologically. For each time period a characteristic object is illustrated, accompanied by text outlining historical and cultural developments.</p>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">Through the Gestalt principles, firstly, the proximity in this book is great. The Italic footnotes on each page are closely connected to the picture provided. Also, there are texts on each page located next to the pictures they are describing. The similarity of each page is high, as there are headlines on the top with the item’s origin, period, and dynasty. This helps this book retain a similar and consistent layout style. Moreover, the closure is designed well. There are lots of negative spaces with blank, pictures and texts located aligned in a kind of grid on each page. This makes readers comfortable viewing the whole book. As each object is located on one page, the continuation of this book is great as well. People may get to know that different object is on a different page, they can read through this.</p>
