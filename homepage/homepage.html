  <h3>I am a super food lover who enjoy seeking great restaurants in New York. After eating around, I picked several my favorite restaurants here. I will post a weekly food journel on this website and share my feelings in these places. My ideal website for this theme is to make a list of my personal recommendation of restaurants in New York. The website I want to make it clean and restaurants can be easily searched. I also come up with an idea that to collect a list of restaurant design, recipe/decoration etc.</h3>
